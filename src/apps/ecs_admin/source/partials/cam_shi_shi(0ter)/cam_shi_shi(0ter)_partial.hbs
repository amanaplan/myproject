			You (an &quot;Authorized User&quot;) desire to access the UPS CampusShip System (the &quot;System&quot;) to ship packages on behalf of your employer (the &quot;Customer&quot;), and UPS desires to grant you certain rights under the System as provided herein.
			<br><br>
			If you have been designated as an Authorized User by Customer, or by an administrator (&quot;Administrator&quot;) for a UPS account or accounts (collectively, the &quot;UPS Account&quot;) assigned to Customer, you may access the online shipping portion of the System (the &quot;Shipping System&quot;), through use of an account for the System (a &quot;System Account&quot;), in order to ship packages on behalf of Customer in accordance with the access rights granted you herein and by your Administrator.
			<br><br>
			Accordingly, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which are acknowledged, the parties agree as follows:
			<br><br>
			1. License Grant and Restrictions.
			<br><br>
			(a) License Grant. If you have been assigned a valid User login ID and Password (defined below) for an Authorized User System Account, UPS grants to you as an Authorized User during the Term:
			<br><br>
			(i) A personal, non-transferable, non-exclusive, non-sublicenseable, revocable, limited license to access and use the Shipping System through your assigned Authorized User System Account to ship packages on behalf of Customer in accordance with the terms hereof and the access rights designated by your Administrator; and
			<br><br>
			(ii) The right through the Shipping System to view and print certain shipment history information regarding only those packages that you shipped on behalf of Customer using the Shipping System (the &quot;Shipping Information&quot;).
			<br><br>
			(b) Restrictions on Use.
			<br><br>
			(i) You shall use the Shipping System solely in connection with Customer's internal business operations and solely in accordance with this Agreement. You agree that all rights to use and/or otherwise exploit the Shipping System not expressly granted to you in this Agreement are reserved by UPS.
			<br><br>
			(ii) You shall not disclose any Shipping Information to any party other than Customer.
			<br><br>
			(iii) Shipping Information is for internal planning purposes and reconciling packages shipped under the UPS Account via the System against the invoice for shipping fees provided by UPS.

For further information on the procedures for service refunds, consult the UPS Rate and Service Guide (currently accessible at www.ups.com/using/services/details/terms.html) in effect at the time of shipment of a package.
			<br><br>
			(c) Inconsistent Use Prohibited. Any access to or use of the System or the Shipping Information that is inconsistent with the terms herein is unauthorized and strictly prohibited without the express prior written consent of UPS.
			<br><br>
			2. Terms of Shipment.

You also agree and acknowledge that carriage hereunder to destinations outside the United States (if applicable) is subject to the rules relating to liability and other terms and conditions established by the Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules Relating to International Carriage by Air (the &quot;Warsaw Convention&quot;) and/or the Convention on the Contract for the International Carriage of Goods by Road (the &quot;CMR Convention&quot;).
			<br><br>
			3. Term. UPS may terminate your access rights upon the expiration or termination of Customer's use of the System. Your access rights may also be terminated at any time by Customer and/or an Administrator, in their sole discretion.
			<br><br>
			4. Passwords. You shall only use your assigned System Account and its associated user login ID and password (as modified by you from time to time, &quot;Password&quot;) to access the System.

You are not permitted to access the System using the Password of any other user of the System.
			<br><br>
			5. Modifications and Additions.
			<br><br>
			(a) Modified Service Terms. UPS reserves the right to modify the terms and conditions of this Agreement or provide additional usage requirements in its sole discretion.

If you do not accept such revisions, UPS may suspend all your privileges to access and use the System until you accept such revision.
			<br><br>

			<br><br>
			7. Authorized User Covenant.
			<br><br>
